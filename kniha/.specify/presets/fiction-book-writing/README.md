# Spec Kit Fiction Book Writing Preset

**Version 1.7.0** · Part of [Spec Kit](https://github.com/adaumann/speckit-preset-fiction-book-writing)

A Spec-Driven Development preset purpose-built for novel and long-form fiction writing. It applies the discipline of structured software development to creative fiction: story bibles instead of architecture docs, scene tasks instead of tickets, quality gates instead of CI checks.

**Key features at a glance:**

- **Story Bible governance** — `constitution.md` is the single source of truth for voice, tense, prose profile, tone, target audience, and language. Every command reads from it; no style drift across sessions.
- **Full story pipeline** — 27 AI commands from first idea (`speckit.specify`) through structural planning (`speckit.plan`, `speckit.outline`), drafting (`speckit.implement`), quality loop (`speckit.checklist`, `speckit.revise`, `speckit.polish`), feedback (`speckit.feedback`), and submission (`speckit.synopsis`, `speckit.query`, `speckit.export`).
- **Multi-POV architecture** — 9 POV modes including alternating, dual, braided, ensemble, mosaic, frame, chorus, and first-person-multiple. `speckit.pov` designs and audits the POV schedule and information asymmetry map.
- **All major plot structures** — Three-Act, Save the Cat, Hero's Journey, Story Circle, Fichtean Curve, Kishōtenketsu, Freytag's Pyramid, Five-Act, and custom. `speckit.plan` adapts the chapter map to your chosen framework.
- **Two style modes** — `author-sample` (extract 8 voice markers from your own prose) or `humanized-ai` (built-in craft ruleset: 5 prose profiles, sensory grounding, filter word purge, off-balance endings, Triple Purpose).
- **Multilingual** — set `Language` (BCP-47) in the story bible once; prose drafting, SSML output, export metadata, and English-specific prose checks all adapt automatically. 12 languages supported.
- **Submission-ready export** — pandoc-based DOCX, EPUB (KDP / IngramSpark / D2D), and LaTeX output. Author name, language, copyright, and "About the Author" back matter all read from the story bible automatically.
- **Audiobook pipeline** — SSML / ElevenLabs audiodraft generation, voice assignments, pronunciation lexicon (W3C PLS 1.0), and stale-draft detection.
- **Cover design** — `speckit.cover` generates a platform-specific cover brief, 3 AI image prompts, and typography placement notes for KDP, IngramSpark, D2D, and social media. 10 style presets.
- **Author bio management** — `speckit.bio` drafts, refines, and generates context-specific bio variants (agent query, reader back matter, platform, social, first-person, press kit). Stored in the story bible; consumed automatically by `speckit.query` and `speckit.export`.
- **Offline semantic search index** - for large fiction projects. Walks all project markdown files, chunks them into ~300-token segments with
metadata (file, section, character IDs, location IDs, date tags), and stores embeddings in a local ChromaDB index (no external services — fully offline). Primary backend  : ChromaDB + sentence-transformers (semantic / vector search). Fallback backend : BM25 keyword search (pure Python, zero ML dependencies)

## Overview

The Fiction Book Writing preset applies the Spec-Driven Development methodology to creative fiction. It provides:

- **27 AI commands** covering every stage from idea to submission-ready manuscript
- **21 templates** for all supporting story documents
- **1 export script** (pandoc-based) for DOCX, EPUB, and LaTeX output
- Support for **9 POV modes** (single, alternating, dual, braided, ensemble, mosaic, frame, chorus, first-person-multiple)
- Support for all major **plot structure frameworks** (Three-Act, Save the Cat, Hero's Journey, Story Circle, etc.)
- Two **style modes**: author voice sample extraction or humanized AI prose principles

The central philosophy: the **story bible** (`constitution.md`) is the governing authority. Every drafted scene, every revision, every checklist gate derives its rules from it.

Each specification run (/speckit.specify) will generate one book, it is a 1:1 relationship. Make sure to give the most detailed specification and plan before implementation.

---

## Prerequisites

This preset requires the following tools installed on your system:

- **[Spec Kit CLI](https://github.com/adaumann/specify)**: The core engine for running commands.
- **Python 3.10+**: Required for export and search indexing scripts.
- **Pandoc**: Required by `speckit.export` for DOCX, EPUB, and LaTeX generation.
- **(Optional) Node.js**: Required if you use certain MCP servers for extended capabilities.

## Tutorials

### Tutorial: Single POV Novel

A single POV novel uses one viewpoint character throughout. This is the simplest architecture and the best starting point for first novels.

#### Step 1 — Establish the Story Bible

```
/speckit.constitution
```

Choose your **style mode**:

- **`author-sample`** — Paste 500–2,000 words from a book or story you've written (or want to emulate). The AI extracts 8 voice markers: POV, tense, rhythm, vocabulary register, sensory density, tone, dialogue style, and anti-patterns.
- **`humanized-ai`** — Use the built-in anti-AI craft ruleset: sensory grounding, character-in-body principles, dialogue subtext rules, filter-word purge.

Choose your **plot structure**: Three-Act Structure, Save the Cat, Hero's Journey, Story Circle, Fichtean Curve, or custom.

This creates `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — the governing authority for all subsequent commands.

#### Step 2 — Write the Story Brief

```
/speckit.specify A 19th-century lighthouse keeper starts receiving telegrams from a ship that sank twenty years ago.
```

The AI produces `spec.md` with:
- A two-sentence **logline**
- **Character arcs** with priorities (P1 = protagonist, P2+ = supporting)
- **Scene beats** in Given/When/Then format
- **Plot requirements** and reader experience goals

#### Step 3 — Clarify Before Planning

```
/speckit.clarify
```

Scans `spec.md` for `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers and ambiguities across:
- Character motivation (why does the keeper not destroy the telegrams?)
- Timeline (when does Act II break happen?)
- POV clarity (how close is the narrative distance?)
- World-building inconsistencies

Writes resolutions directly back into `spec.md`. **Do not skip this step** — ambiguities here multiply into structural problems downstream.

#### Step 4 — Build the Story Structure

```
/speckit.plan
```

Reads `spec.md` and `constitution.md`, produces `plan.md` with:
- Act/phase breakdown aligned to your chosen plot structure
- Chapter-by-chapter map with estimated word counts
- Story bible compliance check gates
- Supporting document map (which templates to populate)

#### Step 5 — Generate Scene Tasks

```
/speckit.tasks
```

Reads `plan.md` and `spec.md`, produces `tasks.md` with:
- Scene-by-scene tasks ordered by act
- A research phase at the top (tasks marked `[BLOCKED]` until research documents exist)
- Critical checkpoint markers between acts
- A polish pass block at the end

#### Step 6 — Structural Check (Pre-Draft)

```
/speckit.analyze
```

Read-only verification that `spec.md` → `plan.md` → `tasks.md` coverage is complete. No file modifications. Fix any gaps before drafting.

#### Step 7 — Generate and Approve Scene Outlines

```
/speckit.outline all
```

Generates one `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>-outline.md` file per scene. Each file contains:
- Opening hook (one concrete sentence)
- Causal beat sequence (ordered, one sentence per beat)
- Character beats (want vs. get for each character present)
- Dialogue requirements (what must be deflected or left unspoken)
- Sensory anchors (drawn from `locations.md`)
- Thematic work (active motif + delivery method)

All files are created with `status: DRAFT`. Review each one, edit freely, then:
- Set `status: APPROVED` → AI drafts the chapter from this outline
- Set `status: SKIP` → you write the chapter yourself; AI skips it entirely

#### Step 8 — Draft

```
/speckit.implement
```

Executes tasks in order. For each chapter:
- If an outline file exists with `status: APPROVED` → uses it as the working brief (overrides `plan.md`)
- If an outline file exists with `status: DRAFT` → **stops** with an outline gate warning
- If an outline file has `status: SKIP` → marks task done, skips to next chapter
- If no outline file exists → falls back to `plan.md` (no gate)

**Author-written path** — generate outline only, no prose:

```
/speckit.implement --outline-only
```

Generates the outline file for the next scene and stops. No `draft/` files are written. You write the chapter in `draft/` manually, then run `speckit.checklist` as normal.

#### Step 9 — Quality Loop (per chapter)

```
/speckit.checklist        ← "unit test" the scene
/speckit.revise           ← fix only failing passages (if needed)
/speckit.polish           ← line-edit pass (only after checklist PASS)
```

This loop is identical whether the prose was AI-drafted or author-written.

Repeat for each chapter. Run `speckit.status` at any time for a dashboard view.

---

### Series Workflow

Planning a multi-book series from scratch adds one persistent authority document — `series/series-bible.md` — that governs canon, character state, and continuity constraints across all books. Every per-book command reads from it automatically.

#### One-Time Series Setup

Run this once before any individual book is planned:

```
/speckit.series init
```

This gathers the series-level parameters interactively:

| Parameter | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Series title | Used to pre-fill every book's spec and constitution |
| Total book count | Can be `open series` if undetermined |
| Genre + Target audience | Pre-filled into each book's constitution — confirm or override per book |
| Overarching dramatic question | The series-level spine; must not be fully answered until the final book |
| Overarching theme | Stated as a question |
| Series POV strategy | Consistency rule across all books |
| Series tense | Consistency rule across all books |
| Series ending contract | What the ending must feel like or resolve — not what happens |

Creates: `series/series-bible.md`

#### Per-Book Cycle

Repeat these steps for every book. The order is fixed — each step feeds the next.

```
Step 1 — speckit.constitution
```
Reads `series/series-bible.md` and pre-fills genre, audience, POV strategy, and tense — you only confirm or override. Set style mode, prose profile, plot structure, and tone.

```
Step 2 — speckit.specify
```
Reads `series/series-bible.md` and pre-fills series title, book position, and opening character states. The story idea is written as a brief shaped by the craft rules from Step 1.

```
Step 3 — speckit.plan
```
Reads both `spec.md` and `constitution.md` (both required). Generates all supporting documents in Phase 0, then builds the beat sheet and scene outline in Phases 1–3. Verifies `series/series-bible.md` and adds the new book entry automatically.

```
Step 4 — speckit.analyze
```
Pre-draft structural alignment check — confirms spec ↔ plan ↔ tasks consistency before any prose is written. Read-only.

Then follow the standard [drafting loop](#drafting-scenes-with-tasks): `outline → implement → checklist → revise → polish`.

#### Between Books

After a book's draft is finalized:

```
/speckit.series update N
```

Syncs `series/series-bible.md` with what actually happened in Book N — new world canon, new continuity constraints, resolved threads, and updated character arc closing states that become Book N+1's opening states.

Then, before writing anything for Book N+1:

```
/speckit.series audit
```

Cross-book continuity check across all books. **This is a mandatory gate** — CRITICAL issues in the series bible must be fixed before the next brief is written. Validates:
- Character state chain: closing state of Book N must match opening state in Book N+1
- World canon consistency: every `SC-NNN` rule across all drafts
- Continuity constraint chain: `STC-NNN` constraints forward from their establishment book
- Unresolved series threads: open `ST-NNN` items with no pay-off book assigned

Once audit is clean, start the per-book cycle again at Step 1.

#### Workspace Structure

A series project uses this layout:

```
<workspace-root>/
├── series/
│   └── series-bible.md              ← series-level canon, shared across all books
│
└── specs/
    ├── 001-book-1-[title]/           ← created by speckit.specify
    │   ├── spec.md
    │   ├── plan.md
    │   ├── tasks.md
    │   ├── characters/               ← each profile has a Series Arc State table
    │   ├── draft/
    │   ├── outlines/
    │   └── .specify/memory/
    │       └── constitution.md       ← has ## IX. Series Context mirroring series-bible.md
    │
    └── 002-book-2-[title]/
        └── ...
```

Book directory names (`NNN-book-N-[title]`) are created automatically by `speckit.specify` for non-standalone books.

#### Switching Between Books

To work on a different book in the series, open its folder as the VS Code workspace root:

```
File → Open Folder → specs/002-book-2-[title]/
```

All commands resolve `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `spec.md`, `draft/`, `outlines/`, and all other paths relative to the active workspace root — so the correct book's files become active automatically. Commands that need `series/series-bible.md` look one level up from the book root to find it.

Each book's constitution is isolated in its own `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Reopening a previous book's folder restores its full context exactly as you left it.

#### Authority Hierarchy

| Document | Scope | Wins over |
|---|---|---|
| `series/series-bible.md` | All books | Any per-book decision on canon, world rules, character state |
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | One book | Any scene, outline, or draft within that book |
| `spec.md` | One book | `plan.md` on story intent |
| `plan.md` | One book | `outlines/*.md` on structural beats |
| `outlines/*.md` | One scene | `draft/*.md` on beat sequence |

---

### Tutorial: Multi-POV Novel

Multi-POV adds an architecture layer on top of the single-POV workflow. You still follow the same planning and drafting steps, but you insert a POV design pass after planning and before tasking.

#### Supported POV Modes

| Mode | Description | Classic Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Alternating** | Two or more POVs in strict rotation | *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* |
| **Dual** | Exactly two POVs, equal weight | *Gone Girl* |
| **Braided** | Three or more POVs, interdependent arcs | *A Song of Ice and Fire* |
| **Ensemble** | Four or more POVs, roughly equal weight | *Donna Tartt's The Secret History* |
| **Mosaic** | Many POVs, loosely connected, fragmented | *Cloud Atlas* |
| **Frame + Embedded** | Outer narrator frames inner story | *Frankenstein* |
| **Chorus** | Collective "we" narrator | *The Virgin Suicides* |
| **First-Person Multiple** | Each POV chapter written in first person | *As I Lay Dying* |

#### Additional Step: POV Architecture

After `speckit.plan`, before `speckit.outline`:

```
/speckit.pov draft
```

This creates `pov-structure.md` with:
- **POV Configuration** table (mode, character count, tense, narrative distance, chapter demarcation)
- **Voice Differentiation Matrix** — how each POV character sounds different (vocabulary register, sentence length, sensory focus)
- **POV Schedule** — chapter-by-chapter assignment of POV characters
- **Information Asymmetry Map** — what each POV character knows and when
- **Convergence Points** — scenes where character arcs intersect
- **Relay Rules** — how POV handoffs between chapters are handled

#### POV Sub-Commands

```
/speckit.pov audit          ← audit voice differentiation across all POV characters
/speckit.pov schedule       ← generate or validate the chapter-by-chapter POV schedule
/speckit.pov asymmetry      ← check that no POV character knows what they shouldn't
/speckit.pov relay          ← review POV handoff transitions between chapters
```

Ask any free-text POV design question and `speckit.pov` will answer without modifying files:

```
/speckit.pov Should Elena's POV come before or after Marcus's in chapter 12?
```

#### Post-Draft: Continuity for Multi-POV

After drafting, `speckit.continuity` is especially important in multi-POV narratives to verify:
- No character acts on information their POV hasn't encountered yet
- Voice register doesn't drift between chapters
- Timeline coherence across interleaved timelines

```
/speckit.continuity
```

Optionally scope to specific chapters:

```
/speckit.continuity JO3.201–JO3.203
```

---

### The Planning Process

The planning phase produces three documents that lock in the story's architecture before a single draft scene is written. The order matters.

```
speckit.constitution  →  speckit.specify  →  speckit.clarify  →  speckit.plan  →  speckit.tasks  →  speckit.outline
```

**`speckit.constitution`** is a prerequisite for everything else. It encodes:
- Your style mode and extracted/manual voice markers
- Plot structure choice (governs how `plan.md` will be structured)
- Central Dramatic Question
- Prohibited phrases (anti-AI filter applied during `speckit.implement`)

**`speckit.specify`** converts a pitch-length idea into a structured brief. Keep your initial prompt concise — one or two sentences. The AI expands it into `spec.md`. You edit `spec.md` directly after.

**`speckit.clarify`** is the most important step to not skip. Gaps in the brief do not disappear when you plan — they become structural holes. Run clarify until `spec.md` has no `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remaining.

**`speckit.plan`** reads the clarified brief and story bible and produces the full act breakdown. If you're using a non-standard plot structure, specify it during `speckit.constitution` setup.

**`speckit.tasks`** reads `plan.md` and converts every chapter beat into an actionable writing task. Tasks are ordered, prioritized by arc, and blocked where prerequisite documents are missing. Resolve blocked tasks by creating the required supporting documents (characters, world-building, research) before drafting those scenes.

**`speckit.outline`** expands each plan entry into a dedicated, author-editable outline file. This is the bridge between structural planning and prose: plan.md captures *what* happens at the story level; the outline file captures *how* the scene plays out beat by beat, with specific sensory anchors and dialogue requirements. The author's review and approval of each outline is the last checkpoint before AI prose is generated.

---

### Analyze Before You Draft

`speckit.analyze` is a mandatory pre-flight check before `speckit.implement`. It is **strictly read-only** — it never modifies files.

```
/speckit.analyze
```

It checks:
- Every spec requirement maps to at least one plan chapter
- Every plan chapter maps to at least one task
- Act proportions are within acceptable range for your plot structure
- No orphan tasks (tasks referencing non-existent plan chapters)
- Story bible principles are not contradicted in `plan.md`

If `speckit.analyze` flags gaps, resolve them in `spec.md`, `plan.md`, or `tasks.md` before proceeding. Drafting over structural holes costs far more revision time than fixing them pre-draft.

---

### Drafting Scenes with Tasks

`speckit.implement` executes one task at a time, in order. It operates in two modes:

#### AI-Drafted Mode (default)

```
/speckit.implement
```

For each chapter:

1. Reads the task from `tasks.md`
2. Checks the checklist gate (previous chapter must pass before continuing)
3. Checks the **outline gate**: if `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>-outline.md` exists with `status: DRAFT`, stops and asks the author to approve it first
4. If outline is `APPROVED`: uses the outline file as the working brief
5. If outline is `SKIP`: marks the task done and moves on — no prose generated for that chapter
6. If no outline file: falls back to `plan.md` directly (same behaviour as before `speckit.outline` existed)
7. Drafts the scene into `draft/`

#### Author-Written Mode (`--outline-only`)

```
/speckit.implement --outline-only
```

Generates the outline file for the next unwritten scene and **stops** — no prose is produced. The author writes the chapter in `draft/` manually (any tool, any format). The same quality loop (`speckit.checklist` → `speckit.revise` → `speckit.polish`) applies regardless of who wrote the prose.

You can also mix modes per scene by setting `status: SKIP` in any individual outline file.

**Check project status at any time:**

```
/speckit.status
```

Produces a dashboard showing word counts (actual vs. estimated), chapter completion status (drafted / revising / polishing / done), and outstanding gates.

---

### Checklist, Polish & Revise

These three commands form the per-chapter quality loop. Run them in this order.

#### 1. Checklist (Unit Test for Prose)

```
/speckit.checklist
```

Validates the *craft layer* of the scene (not plot logic):

| Gate | Description |
|---|---|
| Triple Purpose | Does every scene serve ≥3 narrative functions simultaneously? |
| Off-Balance Ending | Does the scene end in a new instability, not resolution? |
| Embodied Emotion | Are emotions shown through physical reactions, not named? |
| Dialogue Subtext | Does every dialogue exchange carry at least one deflection or misunderstanding? |
| Sensory Anchoring | Is at least one non-visual sense grounded per scene? |
| Prohibited Phrases | Are all AI-sounding phrases (from the story bible list) absent? |

The checklist result is saved to `checklists/<CHAPTER_ID>-checklist.md`.

#### 2. Revise (Surgical Rewrite)

If any gate fails:

```
/speckit.revise A1.101
/speckit.revise A1.101 "CHR-002 STB-004"     ← specify failure codes
/speckit.revise A1.101 checklists/A1.101_Awakening-checklist.md
```

`speckit.revise` rewrites **only the failing passages**. It does not improve surrounding prose or change passing sections. The result is a versioned file (e.g., `Chapter_v2.md`) with a diff summary.

Do not use `speckit.revise` for structural problems — those require changes to `plan.md` and `tasks.md` first.

#### 3. Polish (Line-Edit Pass)

Only run after checklist PASS:

```
/speckit.polish
```

Applies surface-level refinements:

| Fix | Rule |
|---|---|
| Sentence rhythm | Alternates short and long sentences; moves weight to line endings |
| Word repetition | Eliminates same-word echoes within and across adjacent paragraphs |
| Filter words | Removes `she noticed`, `he felt`, `she saw`, `he heard` |
| Adverb density | Caps at 1 adverb per 200 words |
| Weak verbs | Replaces `was`, `had`, `got` with active alternatives |
| Voice register drift | Corrects vocabulary that drifts away from character register |
| Punctuation overuse | Reduces em-dash and ellipsis clusters |
| Paragraph openings | Ensures variety in how paragraphs begin |

`speckit.polish` is a **linter and formatter**, not a structural tool. Never use it to fix story bible violations, missing triple purpose, or off-balance endings — that is `speckit.revise`'s job.

---

### Processing Feedback

Beta-reader, critique-partner, and editorial feedback enters the workflow through `speckit.feedback`.

```
/speckit.feedback feedback-notes.txt --reader-type beta
/speckit.feedback "The pacing in chapters 8–12 dragged and I lost interest in Marcus entirely." "Jane Doe" --reader-type cp
```

The command:
1. Ingests raw notes (file path or quoted block)
2. Categorizes each issue: **Structural / Character / Pacing / Clarity / Factual**
3. Assigns severity: **CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR**
4. Maps issues to specific chapter IDs
5. Generates prioritized revision tasks appended to `tasks.md`
6. Logs everything to `feedback/feedback.md`

Sub-commands for managing the feedback log:

```
/speckit.feedback triage          ← re-categorize existing feedback without regenerating tasks
/speckit.feedback tasks           ← generate tasks from an already-triaged log
```

After feedback ingestion:

```
/speckit.revise                   ← address CRITICAL issues first
/speckit.continuity               ← cross-reference feedback against current drafts
/speckit.status                   ← check overall revision progress
```

---

### Glossary, Research & Versions

#### Maintaining the Glossary

`glossary.md` is generated by `speckit.plan` and seeded from `spec.md` and `constitution.md`. Use `speckit.glossary` to keep it current throughout drafting:

```
/speckit.glossary add "the Shatter"          ← register a new invented term
/speckit.glossary audit                       ← find unregistered terms in draft chapters
/speckit.glossary check                       ← scan drafts for spelling/capitalisation violations
/speckit.glossary                             ← status dashboard (coverage, open violations)
```

`speckit.polish` and `speckit.continuity` both enforce the glossary passively. Run `speckit.glossary check` proactively before polishing a chapter to resolve violations before they get flagged.

#### Tracking Research

`research.md` is generated by `speckit.plan` to log all domain knowledge gaps. Use `speckit.research` to close the loop:

```
/speckit.research add "Victorian-era telegraph protocols"
/speckit.research resolve R-003 --finding "..." --source "..."
/speckit.research check A1.101          ← check one chapter for unsupported claims
/speckit.research status                ← dashboard sorted by authenticity risk
```

Unresolved HIGH-priority research items before drafting those chapters are flagged as blockers by `speckit.help`.

---

### Search Index (RAG)

For large projects (50k+ words), maintaining a mental map of every character mention, world detail, and subplot beat becomes difficult. The Fiction Book Writing preset includes a local **Search Index (RAG)** powered by `scripts/python/index.py` to provide offline semantic and keyword search.

#### How it Works

The indexer chunks your project files (specs, plans, drafts, world-building, etc.) into manageable pieces and stores them in a local vector or keyword database (`.specify/index/`).

- **Semantic Search**: Understands meaning (e.g., searching for "sadness" finds "tears on her cheek"). Requires `chromadb` and `sentence-transformers`.
- **Keyword Search**: Uses BM25 or basic TF scoring as a zero-dependency fallback.

#### Commands

NOTE: These CLI commands are included in the SpeckIt commands. Just for reference

The RAG index is managed via terminal commands (using your Python environment):

```powershell
# 1. Build the initial index (run once your core planning is done)
python scripts/python/index.py build

# 2. Incrementally update the index (run after drafting or significant edits)
python scripts/python/index.py update

# 3. Query the index
python scripts/python/index.py query "how does the protagonist react to fire?"
python scripts/python/index.py query "ancient magic rules" --type world
python scripts/python/index.py query "Elowen" --type draft --top 10

# 4. Check status and staleness
python scripts/python/index.py status
```

#### Backends

1.  **ChromaDB** (Recommended): Provides true semantic search. Enabled by installing:
    `pip install chromadb sentence-transformers`
2.  **BM25**: Better than basic keyword search. Enabled by installing:
    `pip install rank-bm25`
3.  **Basic TF**: A built-in, zero-dependency keyword search that works out-of-the-box.

You can configure your backend preference and path in the **Tooling** section of your `constitution.md`.

---

#### Managing Draft Versions

Each `speckit.revise` and `speckit.polish` run produces a versioned file (`_v2.md`, `_v3.md`, …). Use `speckit.versions` to navigate the history:

```
/speckit.versions list A1.101           ← version timeline for one chapter
/speckit.versions diff A1.101           ← narrative diff: latest vs. previous version
/speckit.versions diff A1.101 v1 v3     ← diff two specific versions
/speckit.versions log                   ← cross-chapter revision history by date
/speckit.versions tag A1.101 v2 beta-reader-1   ← milestone tag for the sent version
```

#### Series Management

For multi-book projects, use `speckit.series` to manage the series bible:

```
/speckit.series init                    ← scaffold series/series-bible.md (before Book 1)
/speckit.series audit                   ← cross-book canon, arc chains, unresolved threads
/speckit.series update 1                ← sync bible after completing Book 1
/speckit.series status                  ← series-wide dashboard
```

#### Workflow Navigation

Start every session with `speckit.help` if you are unsure what to do next:

```
/speckit.help                           ← full guidance report for current project state
/speckit.help "Is my spec ready to plan?"
/speckit.help "I'm stuck after chapter 3"
/speckit.help --chapter A2.201         ← focused advice for one chapter
```

---

### Synopsis & Query Letter

#### Writing the Synopsis

Run `speckit.synopsis` after `speckit.plan` to get an outline-based synopsis, or after drafting for post-draft accuracy.

```
/speckit.synopsis
```

Produces `synopsis.md` with two formats:

- **One-page synopsis** (250–350 words) — the compressed arc, present tense, third person, ending revealed. Required in most query packages.
- **Full synopsis** (1,000–2,000 words) — beat-by-beat account of every major plot turn and character arc resolution. Required on partial/full manuscript requests.

Both formats explicitly reveal the ending. A synopsis is not a blurb.

```
/speckit.synopsis one-page        ← regenerate only the 250–350 word version
/speckit.synopsis full            ← regenerate only the full 1,000–2,000 word version
/speckit.synopsis update          ← regenerate from current draft (post-draft accuracy)
/speckit.synopsis check           ← validate existing synopsis.md against spec.md and plan.md
```

#### Writing the Query Letter

Run `speckit.synopsis` first — `speckit.query` reads `synopsis.md` as its story body source.

```
/speckit.query draft
```

Produces a `query-letter.md` in 250–350 words following the industry-standard four-section format:

1. **Personalization** — why this specific agent (left blank, add manually per submission)
2. **Hook** — protagonist + inciting incident + stakes (≤50 words)
3. **Body** — setup, escalation, central dramatic question (~200 words)
4. **Housekeeping** — word count, genre, comp titles, bio, credentials

Log submissions and suggest comparable titles:

```
/speckit.query update             ← add a submission log entry
/speckit.query track              ← view submission tracker table
/speckit.query comp-titles        ← generate comp title suggestions only
/speckit.query "Sarah Jensen at Foundry Literary"  ← generate personalization paragraph
```

### Export

#### Exporting the Manuscript

Requires [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) installed separately.

```
/speckit.export                   ← DOCX (default, submission-ready)
/speckit.export epub              ← EPUB (KDP / Draft2Digital / IngramSpark)
/speckit.export latex             ← LaTeX (typeset)
```

Chapter assembly logic:
- Prefers `<CHAPTER_ID>_<Title>_polished.md` over base drafts
- Sorts chapters by `chapter_id` from frontmatter
- Highest version number wins (e.g., `_v3.md` beats `_v2.md`)

#### Metadata Resolution

All export metadata is read automatically from `constitution.md § VII` — no manual flags needed unless you want to override:

| Metadata | Source in constitution.md | CLI override |
|---|---|---|
| Author byline | `Author Name` | `--author "Jane Smith"` |
| Language (`dc:language`) | `Language` (BCP-47 code) | `--lang de` |
| Copyright (`dc:rights`) | `Copyright` | `--rights "© 2026 Jane Smith"` |
| "About the Author" | `Author Bio (Long)` | `--author-bio "..."` / `--no-author-bio` |

If `Language` is not set, the export defaults to `en`. Run `speckit.bio draft` to generate the canonical author bio before exporting if you want an "About the Author" section appended.

#### Platform Presets

| Platform flag | Output format | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| *(default)* | DOCX Shunn | Agent/publisher manuscript submission |
| `--platform smashwords` | DOCX | Smashwords aggregator (minimal styles) |
| `--platform kdp` | EPUB | Amazon KDP (cover required for listing) |
| `--platform ingramspark` | EPUB | IngramSpark + accessibility + optional ISBN |
| `--platform d2d` | EPUB | Draft2Digital (no embedded cover) |
| `--platform kdp-print-6x9` | LaTeX | KDP Print 6"×9" |
| `--platform ingramspark-6x9` | LaTeX | IngramSpark 6"×9" (PDF/X-1a notes) |

## POV Modes Reference

| Mode | POV Count | Rotation Pattern | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Single POV** | 1 | N/A | Best for intimate, psychological narratives |
| **Alternating** | 2–4 | Strict rotation between chapters | Parallel storylines converging toward a common climax |
| **Dual** | 2 | Equal weight, chapter by chapter | Dual protagonists with equal narrative importance |
| **Braided** | 3+ | Interdependent, convergence-driven | Complex ensemble with significant plot intersection |
| **Ensemble** | 4+ | Roughly equal weight | Community or group narratives |
| **Mosaic** | Many | Fragmented, loosely connected | Non-linear, thematic over plot-driven |
| **Frame + Embedded** | 2 (outer + inner) | Outer frames inner | Unreliable narrators, stories-within-stories |
| **Chorus** | Collective | "We" narrator | Communities as protagonist |
| **First-Person Multiple** | 2+ | Each chapter in first person | Maximum intimacy, high voice differentiation required |

---

## Plot Structure Support

The preset supports any plot structure. Configure in `speckit.constitution`. The `plan.md` act breakdown adapts to the chosen framework.

| Framework | Act Structure | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Three-Act Structure** | Setup / Confrontation / Resolution | Universal; commercial fiction |
| **Save the Cat** | 15 beats mapped to pages | Genre fiction; screenwriter-influenced |
| **Hero's Journey** | 12 stages (Campbell/Vogler) | Mythic, quest, and coming-of-age |
| **Story Circle** | 8 stages (Dan Harmon) | Character transformation arcs |
| **Fichtean Curve** | Rising crises to climax | Short, crisis-dense narratives |
| **In Medias Res** | Custom entry point | Literary fiction; non-linear structure |
| **Custom** | Author-defined phases | Experimental or hybrid structures |

---

## Style Modes

### Author Voice Sample (`author-sample`)

Paste 500–2,000 words from your own writing or a target author. `speckit.constitution` extracts 8 style markers automatically:

1. **POV & Tense** — narrative distance and temporal mode
2. **Rhythm** — typical sentence length and cadence patterns
3. **Vocabulary Register** — formal vs. colloquial, period-appropriate
4. **Sensory Density** — frequency and type of sensory detail
5. **Tone** — emotional temperature and irony level
6. **Dialogue Style** — attribution patterns, subtext density
7. **Anti-Patterns** — specific phrasings to avoid (extracted from sample)
8. **Scene Integrity Rules** — structural habits in the sample text

### Humanized AI Prose (`humanized-ai`)

Uses the built-in craft ruleset for AI-generated prose that reads as human-crafted. The following **universal principles** apply in all profiles — they cannot be disabled:

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| Sensory grounding | Minimum one non-visual sense per scene |
| Character-in-body | Physical reactions precede named emotions |
| Dialogue subtext | Deflection or misunderstanding in every exchange |
| Filter word purge | No `she noticed`, `he felt`, `she saw`, `he heard` |
| Off-balance ending | Every scene ends in a new instability |
| Triple purpose | Every scene serves ≥3 narrative functions simultaneously |
| Dirt Rule | Every environment has at least one flaw or imperfection |
| Anti-AI Filter | Prohibited phrases list (universal + profile-specific) |

#### Prose Profiles

When using `humanized-ai`, choose a **Prose Profile** to set how the universal principles are weighted. All profiles enforce all universal principles — they differ in sentence rhythm, sensory density, interiority depth, dialogue subtext intensity, and pacing bias.

| Profile | Best For | Sentence Rhythm | Sensory Density | Interiority | Pace Bias |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`commercial`** | General fiction, fantasy, romance | Alternating short/long | Medium | Balanced | Scene = Sequel |
| **`literary`** | Literary fiction, character studies | Long-dominant; fragments under rupture | High (texture) | Deep, contradictory | Reflection-forward |
| **`thriller`** | Thrillers, crime, horror | Short-dominant (1–2 clauses) | Low-medium, functional | Minimal; act-before-reflect | Action-forward |
| **`atmospheric`** | Gothic, horror, weird fiction | Long, winding, syntactically embedded | Maximum; environment as character | Deep; inner/outer blur permitted | Atmosphere as plot |
| **`dark-realist`** | Noir, social realism, gritty literary | Clipped, declarative, no ornament | Medium; decay and failure bias | Cold, selective; rationalisation visible | Consequence-forward |

Each profile also adds its own genre-specific Anti-AI filter entries. Examples:

- **`commercial`** adds: `"a world turned upside down"` · `"everything changes when"`
- **`literary`** adds: `"liminal"` · `"ineffable"` · `"the weight of"` · `"something shifted inside her"`
- **`thriller`** adds: `"heart pounding"` · `"adrenaline surged"` · `"every instinct screamed"`
- **`atmospheric`** adds: `"an oppressive silence"` · `"the darkness seemed alive"` · `"she could feel the history"`
- **`dark-realist`** adds: `"broken but not beaten"` · `"found her strength"` · `"at the end of the day"`

Set the profile using `speckit.constitution` — it will prompt for the choice when initialising `humanized-ai` mode.

## Export Formats

| Format | Use Case | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **DOCX** | Publisher/agent submissions, Word compatibility | pandoc ≥ 2.11 |
| **EPUB** | KDP, Draft2Digital, IngramSpark, Kobo | pandoc ≥ 2.11 |
| **LaTeX** | Professional typesetting, print-on-demand | pandoc ≥ 2.11 + LaTeX distribution |

Install pandoc: [pandoc.org/installing.html](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

All export metadata (author byline, language, copyright, "About the Author" back matter) is read automatically from `constitution.md § VII`. No manual configuration is required for standard exports. See the [Export tutorial](#export) for the full metadata resolution table and CLI overrides.

**Language support**: Set `Language` in `constitution.md § VII` to a BCP-47 code (`en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `pt`, `nl`, `ja`, `zh`, `fi`, `hu`, `tr`). The code is passed as `dc:language` to EPUB, as `lang` metadata to DOCX/LaTeX, and gates English-only prose checks in `speckit.polish` and `speckit.statistics`. See [Language Support](#language-support) for full details.

---

## Language Support

Set `Language` in `constitution.md § VII` to a [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language code. This single field propagates through the entire pipeline:

| BCP-47 Code | Language |
|---|---|
| `en` | English (default) |
| `de` | German |
| `fr` | French |
| `es` | Spanish |
| `it` | Italian |
| `pt` | Portuguese |
| `nl` | Dutch |
| `ja` | Japanese |
| `zh` | Chinese |
| `fi` | Finnish |
| `hu` | Hungarian |
| `tr` | Turkish |

### What the Language field controls

| Command / Output | Effect |
|---|---|
| `speckit.implement` | All drafted prose is written in the set language |
| `speckit.outline` | Scene outlines are written in the set language |
| `speckit.polish` | English-only rules (WR-001, WR-004, DI-001, DI-002) are suppressed when Language ≠ `en`; a note explains which checks were skipped |
| `speckit.statistics` | Flesch–Kincaid readability score is suppressed when Language ≠ `en` (not valid for non-English prose) |
| `speckit.audiobook` | `xml:lang` attribute set on `<speak>` and `<lexicon>` SSML elements; warning issued if TTS voice model may not support the language |
| `speckit.cover` | Tagline length target: ≤8 words for analytic languages; ≤4 compound words for agglutinative languages (de, nl, fi, hu, tr) |
| `speckit.query` | If Language = `de`: generates German Exposé format (Anschreiben + Exposé body + Leseprobe) instead of English query letter |
| `speckit.export` (EPUB) | Passed as `dc:language` metadata; sets pandoc `--metadata lang=<code>` |
| `speckit.export` (DOCX/LaTeX) | Passed as pandoc `lang` metadata |
| `audiobook-draft-template.md` | `xml:lang` placeholder pre-filled from Language |

### Setting the language

Run `speckit.constitution` and set the `Language` field in Section VII, or edit `constitution.md` directly:

```yaml
language: de
```

The CLI `--lang` flag overrides `constitution.md` for a single export run without changing the stored value:

```
/speckit.export epub --lang de
```

## Comparable Products

**General-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini direct)**

Most writers using AI are just chatting with these directly — "write chapter 3", "make this better". ChatGPT Projects and Claude Projects now offer persistent memory and context management, which helps with session continuity. What they still lack is a consistency *model*: no quality gates, no structural governance, no constitution-based authority that every command obeys. Chapter 10 can still sound nothing like chapter 1 unless you manually enforce the rules in every prompt. This preset's architecture removes that manual burden and replaces it with automated enforcement.

**Sudowrite — the closest real competitor**

Sudowrite is purpose-built for fiction, has a chapter-by-chapter approach, and has the most polish of any dedicated tool. Where this preset wins: structural governance. Sudowrite helps you write scenes but doesn't enforce that the scenes are structurally coherent with the plan, that characters are arc-consistent, or that your invented terminology is spelled the same way throughout. It's a creative accelerator; this is a production system. Sudowrite also has no equivalent to the quality gates — it will just write whatever you ask.

**NovelAI**

Primarily a continuous text generator, not a workflow tool. Strong on keeping prose in a specific style (model fine-tuning approach rather than rule approach). No structural planning, no version management, no quality gates. Different use case entirely — closer to a co-author than a workflow system.

**Scrivener + AI plugins**

Scrivener is still the best document management tool for long-form writing. This preset has no file browser, no corkboard, no compile system. The two are complementary, not competing — speckit.export via pandoc covers the export gap but doesn't replace Scrivener's organizational model. A writer using this preset still needs something to manage raw files.

**ProWritingAid / AutoCrit / Hemingway**

These are manuscript analyzers, not AI writers. They catch passive voice, overused words, pacing issues. speckit.polish and speckit.checklist cover some of the same ground but from a craft principle angle rather than a statistical frequency angle. These tools are better at surface-level prose quality; this system is better at structural and voice-consistency enforcement.

**Plottr / Fictionary / Campfire**

Planning tools, not AI writers. Plottr is excellent for outlining. This preset's speckit.plan + speckit.outline + speckit.analyze covers equivalent structural ground but is AI-generated and directly connected to the drafting pipeline — the outline isn't a separate document you maintain manually, it becomes the working brief for prose generation.

**The honest gap vs. Sudowrite specifically**

Sudowrite's "Shrink Ray", "Describe", and "Brainstorm" features are genuinely better at in-the-moment creative assistance — the micro-level stuff. If you're stuck on one paragraph, Sudowrite is faster. This preset is better when the problem is the whole book — consistency, structure, arc tracking, series management across 80,000–300,000 words.

**The positioning in one sentence**

Most AI writing tools are accelerators (write faster). This preset is a production system (write consistently, at publishable quality, with structural integrity). That's a different — and currently underserved — market. The writers who will get the most value are those who've already discovered that raw AI writing creates a mess at novel scale.
