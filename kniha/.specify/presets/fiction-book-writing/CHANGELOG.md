## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `scripts/python/index.py` — Offline semantic and keyword search index (RAG) for large fiction projects.
- Support for multiple indexing backends:
    - **ChromaDB**: Vector/semantic search using `sentence-transformers` (optional: `pip install chromadb sentence-transformers`).
    - **BM25**: Keyword-based scoring (optional: `pip install rank-bm25`).
    - **TF**: Zero-dependency fallback keyword search.
- Adaptive chunking for project files (specs, plans, drafts, characters, world-building, etc.).
- Metadata-aware search: Filter results by document type, characters, or locations.
- `constitution-template.md` — New **Search Index (RAG)** configuration section in Tooling.
- Incremental updates: `index.py update` only processes changed files based on mtime manifest.

- `speckit.status` — audiobook-only mode: when `draft/` is absent, shows Audiodraft Inventory table (from `audiodraft/`) cross-referenced against `plan.md` instead of generic "No chapters drafted yet"

---

## [1.4.1] - Current

### Changed
- `speckit.brainstorm` — significant improvements to the interactive loop:
  - **Session length modes**: `quick` (~5 Qs), `standard` (~10 Qs, default), `deep` (unlimited); depth gate surfaces a stopping point when the limit is reached
  - **Resume support**: detects prior `brainstorm-[topic].md` notes and offers to load them as additional context or start fresh
  - **Challenge mode**: `challenge` argument inverts question priority to stress-test existing file decisions rather than fill gaps
  - **Secondary context loading**: each topic silently loads related files (e.g. `characters` brainstorm also loads `spec.md` and `themes.md`) to prevent redundant questions and surface cross-topic conflicts
  - **`!skip` command**: skip any question without answering; skipped questions do not count toward the depth limit
  - **Expanded question banks**: `pov` (5→10 questions), `research` (4→9), `glossary` (3→8)
  - **Wildcard bank**: 8 topic-agnostic generative questions drawn once core gaps are covered
  - **Specific synthesis guidance** in Step 4b: acknowledgements must name a narrative function, a tension, or an affected scene beat — generic filler is explicitly prohibited
  - **Merge output option**: after a multi-topic session (`switch` used), produces a single cross-topic file with a `Cross-Topic Connections` section
  - **Change Candidates Status column**: `PENDING` → `APPLIED` / `SKIPPED` / `EDITED` tracked during Step 6 review
  - **Blank-slate template population**: when creating a topic file from a template, replaces `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` tokens with brainstorm insights; leaves all other placeholders intact
  - **New handoffs**: `speckit.clarify` and `speckit.pov` added to frontmatter
  - **Operating Rules**: three new rules — depth is binding, acknowledgements must be specific, prior session data is read-only
