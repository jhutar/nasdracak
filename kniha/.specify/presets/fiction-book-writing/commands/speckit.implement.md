## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before drafting)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_implement` key
- Process as standard hook block (Optional/Mandatory). Skip silently if absent.

**Update search index** (large projects):
- Check whether `scripts/python/index.py` exists and `.specify/index/` exists (index has been built).
- If both exist, run: `python scripts/python/index.py update` from the project root before drafting begins.
- This ensures semantic search reflects the latest draft files and supporting documents.
- If the command fails or either path is absent, skip silently.

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse `FEATURE_DIR` and available documents list.

2. **Check checklist gates** (if `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in `checklists/`
   - For each checklist, count total items vs. completed items (`- [x]` or `- [X]`)
   - If ANY checklist has incomplete items, output a status table and **stop**:
     ```
     ⚠️ CHECKLIST GATE: Incomplete quality gates detected.

     | Checklist | Total | Complete | Incomplete |
     |---|---|---|---|
     | [name] | N | N | N |

     These checklists must be completed before drafting continues.
     To override: explicitly confirm "proceed despite incomplete checklists"
     ```
   - If the user explicitly confirms, proceed with a warning in the draft output

2b. **Check outline gate** (if `FEATURE_DIR/outlines/` exists):
   - After resolving the target chapter ID (from `$ARGUMENTS` or the first unchecked task), look for a matching outline file at `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>-outline.md`
   - If a matching outline file exists:
     - Read its `status` field from the frontmatter
     - If `status: DRAFT` — stop and display:
       ```
       ⚠️ OUTLINE GATE: outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>-outline.md has status: DRAFT.

       Review the scene outline, edit beats and requirements as needed, then set:
           status: APPROVED

       To write this chapter yourself instead, set:
           status: SKIP

       Then re-run /speckit.implement
       ```
     - If `status: SKIP` — do not generate any prose for this chapter. Instead:
       - Report: `⏭ SKIP: <CHAPTER_ID> <ChapterName> — author will write this chapter. No prose generated.`
       - Mark the corresponding task `[x]` in `tasks.md` with a note: `[author-written — no AI draft]`
       - Update the `## Scene Outline` entry status in `plan.md` from `outline` → `author-draft`
       - Advance to the next unchecked task and repeat the outline gate check
     - If `status: APPROVED` — proceed to drafting using the outline file as the working brief (see step 4)
   - If no outline file exists for this chapter — proceed using `plan.md ## Scene Outline` as the working brief (legacy behaviour, no gate applied)

3. **Load context**:
   - Read `tasks.md` — identify the first group of unchecked tasks (respect `[P]` markers for parallel drafting)
   - Read `plan.md` for the full beat sheet and scene outlines (the `## Plot Beat Sheet` and `## Scene Outline` sections are the primary drafting brief)
   - Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for story bible (style mode, stylistic parameters, story-specific Anti-AI phrases, series context, audiobook config). Explicitly extract:
     - **Tense** (`§VII Tense`) — every sentence of prose must be in this tense; do not drift to a different tense even when summarising backstory or writing internal monologue unless the tense is `mixed` and the rule for when to switch is specified
     - **Sentence Rhythm** (`§VII Sentence Rhythm`) — apply the story-specific rhythm pattern (e.g. "short/jagged during panic; long/winding during reflection") as the baseline; the active prose profile may override for specific scenes
     - **Tone** (`§VII Tone`) and **Target Audience** (`§VII Target Audience`) — these govern emotional register, vocabulary ceiling, content complexity, and how explicit themes, violence, or sexuality may be rendered. If Tone is set, every scene must sustain it. If Target Audience is set, content, vocabulary register, and prose complexity must stay appropriate for that audience.
   - Read `.specify/memory/craft-rules.md` for craft rules (Sections II–VI: Dirt Rule, Physical Feedback, Triple Purpose, Oblique Dialogue, universal Anti-AI Filter, active prose profile definition)
   - Read `characters.md` (index) and the POV character's profile at `characters/[name].md` if present (voice signatures, micro-obsessions)
   - Read the relevant section of `timeline.md` for the chapters being drafted
   - Read the `LOC-NNN` block(s) in `locations.md` matching the chapter's setting — load: Sensory Anchors, Atmosphere by Time/Condition row matching `timeline_position`, Character Relationships for the POV character, Dirt Rule detail options, prohibited uses. If `locations.md` does not exist or the location has no entry, continue without it but flag it in the draft notes block.
   - If user specified a chapter ID or range in `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., `A1.101` or `A1.101–A1.103` for three-act, `JO3.201–JO3.203` for Hero's Journey), use that range
   - If no argument given, use the first unchecked task that has a `draft/` output path
   - **Large project optimization** (if `.specify/index/` exists and project has >30 drafted chapters): instead of loading all `characters/*.md` profiles and full `world-building.md`, run targeted queries scoped to this chapter's POV character and setting:
     ```
     python scripts/python/index.py query "[POV_CHARACTER] voice register micro-obsession stress tells" --type character --top 3
     python scripts/python/index.py query "[SETTING_NAME] sensory anchors atmosphere" --type world --top 2
     python scripts/python/index.py query "[CHAPTER_ID] [POV_CHARACTER]" --type outline --top 1
     ```
     Use returned chunks to supplement or replace loading full files when combined file size approaches context limits.

4. **Resolve the target chapter outline**:
   - **Priority order for the working brief**:
     1. If `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>-outline.md` exists with `status: APPROVED` → use the outline file as the sole working brief. Extract: opening hook, beat sequence, character beats, dialogue requirements, sensory anchors, thematic work from the outline file sections.
     2. Otherwise → fall back to `plan.md ## Scene Outline` entry. Extract: POV, setting, timeline position, estimated length, opening hook, key beats (in order), character beats, dialogue requirements, sensory details, thematic work, closing beat.
   - This resolved content is the **working brief** — follow it, do not improvise structure
   - If the working brief contains `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers, pause and resolve them with the user before drafting
   - If the outline file and `plan.md` conflict on structural beats, the **outline file wins** (it is the author's last-reviewed version). Note the conflict in the draft's `DRAFT NOTES` block.

5. **Draft the chapter**:

   **`--outline-only` mode**: If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--outline-only`:
   - Run `speckit.outline` behaviour for the target chapter(s) instead of drafting prose
   - Generate `outlines/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>-outline.md` with `status: DRAFT`
   - Do **not** write any prose or create any file in `draft/`
   - Report the outline file path(s) and remind the author to review, then either approve or set `status: SKIP` and re-run `/speckit.implement`
   - Stop after generating outlines

   **Prose language**: Draft all prose written *into the chapter draft file* in the language specified in `constitution.md § VII Language`. If Language is not set or not recognised, default to English. **All command output, status messages, confirmations, and conversational responses remain in English regardless of the Language setting.**

   **Output path**: `draft/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>.md`
   **Naming convention**: `{PREFIX}{phase}.{beat_number}_{ShortName}.md` where PREFIX is the plot-structure prefix from `constitution.md` (e.g., `A` = three-act, `JO` = Hero's Journey, `SC` = Save the Cat, `KT` = Kishōtenketsu, `FT` = Freytag, `SL` = Story Circle, `FA` = Five-Act, `P` = generic). Examples: `draft/A1.101_Awakening.md`, `draft/JO3.201_SupremeOrdeal.md`
   Create `draft/` directory in `FEATURE_DIR` if it does not exist.

   **Every draft file MUST begin with this header block** (machine-readable; do not omit or reorder fields):
   ```
   ---
   chapter_id: A1.101   # e.g. A1.101 (three-act) or JO3.201 (heros-journey)
   chapter_name: Awakening
   beat_id: A1.101      # same as chapter_id
   pov_character: [Character Name]
   pov_type: [3rd person limited / 1st person / 3rd person omniscient]
   act_phase: [Act I / Act II-A / Act II-B / Act III]
   plot_structure_stage: [e.g., Inciting Incident / Midpoint / All Is Lost]
   timeline_position: [e.g., Day 3, late afternoon]
   estimated_words: [number from scene outline]
   actual_words: [fill after writing]
   status: draft
   version: 1
   outline_ref: plan.md#scene-outline
   drafted: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   constitution_version: [hash or date of constitution.md used]
   ---
   ```
   Fields are used by `speckit.continuity` and `speckit.revise` for machine-readable chapter identification and continuity checking. `actual_words` and `status` must be filled after writing.

   **Before writing**:
   - Confirm POV character's full profile from `characters/[name].md` is loaded — specifically: voice register, vocabulary pool, micro-obsession state for this phase, current emotional state per the arc progression table, active self-deception pattern, and stress tells
   - Confirm the Triple Purpose: this chapter must advance plot + reveal character + deepen world
   - Note the opening hook — the draft MUST open with it (or a refined version true to its intent)
   - Note the closing beat — the draft MUST end with it (off-balance, no tidy summary)

   **While writing** (enforce story bible):
   - Apply the active style mode from `constitution.md`:
     - `author-sample`: match voice, rhythm, and sensory density from the extracted style markers
     - `humanized-ai`: apply Sections II–VI from `.specify/memory/craft-rules.md` (Dirt Rule, Physical Feedback, Oblique Dialogue, Triple Purpose, etc.) plus story-specific Anti-AI phrases from `constitution.md §VII`
   - Follow the key beats from the scene outline in causal order — each beat produces the next
   - Deliver the dialogue requirements: each critical exchange uses oblique dialogue (deflection before honest answer), includes the misunderstanding/word-failure moment if specified
   - Include the required sensory details; at minimum, the primary anchor from `locations.md` (or the scene outline if no location entry exists) and one Dirt Rule imperfection from the location's options
   - Carry the thematic work through action and image — never state the theme in dialogue
   - Show emotions through involuntary physical reactions — do not name feelings
   - Each character present gets ≥1 physical action per scene, not tagged with emotion
   - Em-dash cap: ≤3 per 1,000 words across the whole chapter
   - Self-check before finalizing: scan for prohibited phrases from the Anti-AI Filter

   **After writing the chapter**:
   - Write draft to `draft/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>.md`
   - Update `status` field in the matching `## Scene Outline` entry from `outline` → `in-draft`
   - Mark the corresponding task `[x]` in `tasks.md`
   - Note any new Chekhov items discovered during drafting — add to the Open Threads table in `plan.md`
   - If the scene changes the physical state of any `LOC-NNN` location (damage, new fixture, change of ownership, destruction), add a row to that location's **State Log** in `locations.md`
   - Note any deviations from the scene outline (additions, cuts, structural changes) as a comment block at the top of the draft file:
     ```
     <!-- DRAFT NOTES

5b. **Generate audiobook draft** (if `OUTPUT_MODE` is `audiobook` or `both` in `constitution.md ## X`):

   Read from `constitution.md ## X. Audiobook Production`:
   - `TTS_ENGINE` (`ssml-cloud`, `elevenlabs`, or `both`)
   - `SPEAKER_MODE` (`single` or `multi`)
   - Speaker Configuration table (narrator + per-character voice IDs)
   - Pronunciation Lexicon table
   - Audiobook Style Hints table

   Source: the prose draft just written in step 5.
   Template: `templates/audiobook-draft-template.md` — use this as the structural model for generated files.

   **Output paths** (create `audiodraft/` in `FEATURE_DIR` if it does not exist):
   - SSML-cloud: `audiodraft/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>.ssml`
   - ElevenLabs: `audiodraft/<CHAPTER_ID>_<ChapterName>_el.xml`
   - Lexicon sidecar (ElevenLabs, shared across all chapters): `audiodraft/lexicon.pls`

   **File header** (top of every audiobook draft file, both formats):
   ```yaml
   ---
   chapter_id: [CHAPTER_ID]
   chapter_name: [CHAPTER_NAME]
   audiobook_format: ssml-cloud | elevenlabs | both
   speaker_mode: single | multi
   source_draft: draft/[CHAPTER_ID]_[CHAPTER_NAME].md
   status: audiodraft
   generated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   ---
   ```

   **Prose-to-audio transformation rules (apply to both formats)**:
   - Strip all markdown formatting: `**bold**` → plain text, `_italic_` marks for `<emphasis>`, `# headings` → chapter title spoken aloud as opening line
   - Em-dash (—) mid-sentence → `<break time="250ms"/>`
   - Ellipsis (…) trailing off → `<break time="400ms"/>`
   - Paragraph break → `<break time="600ms"/>`
   - Scene break (`---` or `* * *`) → `<break time="1500ms"/>`
   - Italics (`_text_`) → `<emphasis level="moderate">text</emphasis>`
   - ALL CAPS → `<emphasis level="strong">text</emphasis>`
   - Every word in the Pronunciation Lexicon → wrap with `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="[IPA]">[WORD]</phoneme>` (SSML) or substitute the ElevenLabs Substitute value inline (EL)
   - Audiobook Style Hints → applied as `<!-- DELIVERY: [hint] -->` comments before the relevant passage, and as `<prosody>` attributes where applicable

   **SSML-cloud output rules** (`ssml-cloud` or `both`):
   - Root element: `<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US">`
   - Wrap full chapter narration in `<voice name="[NARRATOR_VOICE_SSML]">`
   - In `multi` speaker mode: each character's dialogue is wrapped:
     ```xml
     </voice>
     <voice name="[CHARACTER_VOICE_SSML]">
       [dialogue text with phonemes and breaks]
     </voice>
     <voice name="[NARRATOR_VOICE_SSML]">
     ```
   - In `single` speaker mode: all text stays inside the narrator `<voice>` block; dialogue gets `<prosody rate="95%" pitch="-2st">` unless a Style Hint overrides it
   - Close with `</voice></speak>`

   **ElevenLabs output rules** (`elevenlabs` or `both`):
   - ElevenLabs v2 API accepts: `<break>`, `<phoneme alphabet="ipa">`, `<emphasis>` — use only these tags
   - In `multi` speaker mode: split the chapter into contiguous per-voice **segments**. Each segment is a self-contained `<speak>` block preceded by a routing comment:
     ```xml
     <!-- VOICE: [EL_VOICE_ID] | role: narrator -->
     <speak>[narration text]<break time="600ms"/></speak>

     <!-- VOICE: [EL_VOICE_ID] | role: [CHARACTER_NAME] -->
     <speak>[dialogue text]</speak>
     ```
   - In `single` speaker mode: one `<speak>` block with `<!-- VOICE: [NARRATOR_EL_VOICE_ID] | role: narrator -->` header
   - ElevenLabs Substitute values from the Pronunciation Lexicon replace the source word directly in the text (the `.pls` file handles phonetic mapping on the EL platform side)
   - Emit an info comment at the top of the file:
     ```xml
     <!-- ELEVENLABS AUDIOBOOK DRAFT
          Chapter:      [CHAPTER_ID] [CHAPTER_NAME]
          Speaker mode: single | multi
          Segments:     N
          Lexicon:      audiodraft/lexicon.pls
          Generated:    [DATE]
          API hint:     POST /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
                        model_id: eleven_multilingual_v2 or eleven_turbo_v2_5
                        Pass each segment's <speak> content as the `text` field. -->
     ```

   **Lexicon sidecar `audiodraft/lexicon.pls`** (ElevenLabs or both — create once, append on each chapter run):
   - If file does not exist, create it with the PLS header and all current Pronunciation Lexicon entries
   - If it exists, append only new entries not already present:
     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <lexicon version="1.0"
              xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon"
              alphabet="ipa" xml:lang="en">
       <lexeme>
         <grapheme>Caoimhe</grapheme>
         <phoneme>ˈkiːvə</phoneme>
       </lexeme>
     </lexicon>
     ```

   **Report** (append to step 6 output):
   ```
   | Audiobook | audiodraft/[CHAPTER_ID]_[CHAPTER_NAME].ssml  | SSML segments: N |
   | Audiobook | audiodraft/[CHAPTER_ID]_[CHAPTER_NAME]_el.xml | EL segments: N  |
   | Lexicon   | audiodraft/lexicon.pls                        | Entries: N      |
   ```
   If any Pronunciation Lexicon entries still have `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` for IPA or Substitute: emit `⚠️ Lexicon incomplete — review audiodraft/lexicon.pls before synthesis.`
          Deviation from outline: [describe any deviation]
          New Chekhov items: [list any]
          Unresolved items: [list any]
     -->
     ```

   **If a new unplanned beat is needed** (discovered during drafting — a missing transition, a required setup scene, etc.):
   - **STOP drafting**. Do not write the chapter yet.
   - Notify the user: "Drafting [CHAPTER_ID] requires an unplanned beat: [description]. This must be added to plan.md before drafting continues."
   - Add a full Scene Outline entry for the new chapter in `plan.md ## Scene Outline` (all required fields: POV, setting, opening hook, key beats, closing beat, etc.)
   - Assign the new chapter a beat ID that fits sequentially (insert fractional if needed, e.g., `A1.103b` for three-act or `JO3.201b` for Hero's Journey)
   - Add a corresponding task entry in `tasks.md` immediately after the related task — `plan.md` is updated first, `tasks.md` mirrors it
   - Resume drafting only after both files are updated
   - **`plan.md` is the authoritative chapter list. `tasks.md` must never contain chapters that are not in `plan.md ## Scene Outline`.**

6. **Stop and report**: After completing the requested chapter(s) (or one beat, if no range specified), report:
   - Chapters drafted and their output paths in `draft/`
   - Word count of each chapter vs. estimated length from scene outline
   - Any story bible violations caught and corrected
   - Any deviations from the scene outline
   - Any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items encountered
   - Next recommended chapter ID
   - Recommended next task range

7. **Agent context update**: Run the agent script to refresh the story context file with the newly drafted chapters.

8. **Check for extension hooks** (after drafting): check `hooks.after_implement`.
